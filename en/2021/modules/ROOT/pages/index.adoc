== Background

Global Nodes Meetings are an opportunity for all GBIF nodes to come together to learn from each other, discuss ideas, develop best practices, share their concerns, define recommendations and set priorities.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Nodes Steering Group (NSG) decided to hold the first-ever virtual global nodes meeting in 2021. The idea was presented to the nodes in a https://www.gbif.org/event/7663dO18Hx7Moqmx5GXm08/gbif-community-webinar-february-2021[community webinar^] in February 2021.

The agenda for this event was developed following a https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3IU7OlpnosluP-HykdEk5k950B0omJNTgHRx0dl3G0/edit?usp=sharing[consultation with all nodes^] on ideas for the virtual nodes meetings in 2021.

All activities took place in the week 28 June–2 July 2021. All sessions were be recorded and recordings of the sessions are available from this website.
