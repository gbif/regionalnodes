= Collaboration for thematic engagement 

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
This interactive session builds on the discussions introduced in the previous session. GBIF nodes will work in small groups to explore opportunities for collaboration around specific biodiversity-relevant themes, including agrobiodiversity, invasives, marine biodiversity, and Indigenous data governance, as well as other emerging thematic areas of relevance. Participants will identify key partners, map opportunities, and outline practical strategies for engagement, with a focus on national relevance, ethical considerations, and actionable next steps. By the end of the session, nodes should have developed concrete ideas for strengthening partnerships and expanding their role as bridges to new data communities.
