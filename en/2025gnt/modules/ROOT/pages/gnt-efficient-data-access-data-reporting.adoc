= Efficient data access for data reporting

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
This topic relates to approaches to efficiently access GBIF data for the purpose of generating data reports. Recent developments at GBIF include the availability of GBIF snapshots on cloud computing infrastructures and the ability to query GBIF using SQL allowing for e.g. data metrics and custom data reports rather than downloading individual records. Additionally, emerging data cube formats will provide an opportunity to efficiently analyze biodiversity trends on spatiotemporal data.
