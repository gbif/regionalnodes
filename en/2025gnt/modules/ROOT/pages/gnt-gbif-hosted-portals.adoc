= GBIF hosted portals

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
Participant nodes play an essential role in promoting the use of biodiversity data mobilized by the GBIF network. To further support their engagement across national, institutional, regional and thematic levels, the GBIF Secretariat has developed a fully hosted service that provides simple, customizable biodiversity data portals to GBIF Participant nodes and their partners. In addition to nodes using hosted portals as their own national or network portals, nodes can offer hosted portals as a service to data publishers in their networks. 

Each hosted portal is a simple website hosted and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure. The programme complements other tools available through the network by lowering the technical threshold for maintaining a branded web presence displaying a targeted subset of the data and information already available through GBIF.org.
