= Metabarcoding data

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
GBIF has recently launched the pilot phase for the Metabarcoding Data Programme, intended to improve GBIF’s integration of DNA metabarcoding data on biodiversity. In part a response to the ongoing effort to enrich the GBIF data model, the programme establishes a framework for GBIF nodes to support and engage communities of researchers who collect and manage such evidence using a newly developed tool, the Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT).

== Learning objectives

* Identify the key components and workflow of metabarcoding data processing
* Identify opportunities for working with the DNA community
* Demonstrate knowledge of the Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT)
* Standardize and format metabarcoding datasets
* Publish metabarcoding datasets to GBIF
