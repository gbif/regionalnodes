= Metabarcoding data

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
GBIF has recently launched the pilot phase for the Metabarcoding Data Programme, intended to improve GBIF’s integration of DNA metabarcoding data on biodiversity. In part a response to the ongoing effort to enrich the GBIF data model, the programme establishes a framework for GBIF nodes to support and engage communities of researchers who collect and manage such evidence using a newly developed tool, the Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT).
====

== Learning objectives

[NOTE.objectives]
====
After completing this module, you should be able to perform the following:

* Define and explain what DNA metabarcoding data are
* Describe the significance of metabarcoding data
* Identify the key components and workflow of metabarcoding data processing
* Identify opportunities for working with the DNA community
* Understand practical applications of metabarcoding for biodiversity monitoring.
* Compare strengths and limitations of metabarcoding versus traditional methods.
* Recognize the types of data produced and how such data could be mobilized through GBIF.
* Demonstrate knowledge of the Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT)
* Standardize and format metabarcoding datasets
* Publish metabarcoding datasets to GBIF

=== Decoding metabarcoding

[NOTE.activity]
====
For this activity, group members will look at practical applications of metabarcoding for biodiversity monitoring and compare strengths and limitations of metabarcoding versus traditional methods.

*Instructions*

. Appoint a recorder and a presenter.
. Select a scenario.
. Brainstorm answers to questions.
. Report back across groups.

*Scenarios*

****
_Freshwater Monitoring_

*Scenario*: A national park authority wants to monitor aquatic invertebrate diversity in rivers to assess ecosystem health.

*Traditional approach*: Kick-sampling, expert ID under microscope.

*Task*: Consider how metabarcoding could complement or replace this, what data it generates, and why it matters.
****

****
_Soil Microbial Communities_

*Scenario*: An agricultural research institute is studying soil microbes that contribute to nitrogen fixation and drought tolerance in crops.

*Traditional approach*: Culture-based methods.

*Task*: Discuss how metabarcoding improves coverage of microbial diversity and generates data usable for agri-biodiversity planning.
****

****
_Invasive Species Detection_

*Scenario*: A port authority is monitoring ballast water for invasive species introduction.

*Traditional approach*: Manual sampling and visual identification.

*Task*: Explore how metabarcoding could provide faster, broader detection.
****

****
_Pollinator Communities_

*Scenario*: A conservation NGO wants to identify pollinator species visiting crops in fragmented landscapes.

*Traditional approach*: Manual observation and specimen collection.

*Task*: Consider DNA metabarcoding of pollen loads as a method for detecting plant–pollinator networks.
****

*Questions*

* Application: How could metabarcoding be applied in this scenario?
* Comparison: Why might metabarcoding be better suited (or not) compared to traditional methods?
* Data Types: What kinds of biodiversity data would this generate (e.g., species occurrence, relative abundance, community composition, functional diversity)?
* GBIF Relevance: How could this data be mobilized to GBIF, and who would benefit from its use?
* Challenges: What are potential obstacles (technical, capacity, data standards, cost, reference library gaps)?

At the conclusion of the activity, each group will select someone to report back in plenary.

=== Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT)

[NOTE.activity]
====
For this activity, individuals will perform a series of steps using the MDT Sandbox (Demo Installation) and an example dataset to learn how the tool works.

*Instructions*

. Login to https://mdt.gbif-test.org/ with your GBIF login.
* Complete steps 1-6 of the https://docs.gbif-test.org/mdt-user-guide/en/#simple_quick_start[Simple Quick Start Guide^].
. Please bring up any points of confusion or questions you might have so we can discuss them as a group.
====

== Action plan

[NOTE.assignments]
====
The trainers will conclude the topic and offer an action plan for you to reflect on this topic post-training.
