== Goal

Nodes within the region meet every second year to learn from each other, exchange experiences, discuss ideas, develop good practices, share common challenges, define regional recommendations and set priorities for collaboration and engagement within GBIF.

== Participants

Participants include GBIF node managers and members of regional node support teams, creating a space for practical exchange between those directly involved in coordinating and supporting GBIF activities in the region. Observers may also be invited where relevant, with participation supported through a combination of GBIF funding, self-funded attendance and in-kind support from meeting hosts and regional partners.
