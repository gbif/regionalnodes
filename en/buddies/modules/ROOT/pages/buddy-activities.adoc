= Buddy activities

== Kick-off call
We encourage all buddy groups to organize a call before the Global Nodes events take place.

We suggest three activities for this call:

. Complete or review your capacity self-assessment and, based on the results, discuss the capacity strengths and needs of each of your nodes.
. Describe your node’s model to your buddies and discuss similarities and differences.
. Review the Global Nodes Meeting agenda and help any newer nodes to understand the context around the discussion topics.

== Meet up
If you’re going to be present in Canberra, we also encourage you to plan for a meet up.
