= Buddy activities

== Kick-off call
We encourage all buddy groups to organize a call before the Global Nodes events take place.

We suggest three activities for this call:

. Complete or review your https://www.gbif.org/tool/6Y2SqK8XokHUqIFUn6TLxX/online-capacity-self-assessment-tool-for-national-biodiversity-information-facilities[capacity self-assessment^] and, based on the results, discuss the capacity strengths and needs of each of your nodes.
. Describe your node’s model to your buddies and discuss similarities and differences.
. Review the Global Nodes Meeting agenda and help any newer nodes to understand the context around the discussion topics.

== Meet up
If you’re going to be present in Canberra, we also encourage you to plan for a meet up.
