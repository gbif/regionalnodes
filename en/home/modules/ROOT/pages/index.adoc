GBIF Regional Nodes Meetings bring together node managers and support teams within each region to strengthen coordination, share practices and align regional priorities with the broader GBIF network.

These meetings provide a structured space for regional exchange, collaboration and planning, ensuring that regional perspectives inform global GBIF activities and that nodes can work together on common priorities.

*Objectives of regional nodes meetings*

Regional nodes meetings aim to:

* Support regional coordination, led by the regional representatives
* Facilitate regional collaboration by allowing nodes to share updates on their activities, receive peer feedback and discuss joint project proposals through CESP and other programmes
* Provide feedback to the GBIF Secretariat and NSG on regional issues and priorities
* Develop stronger regional engagement in GBIF by identifying outreach strategies and actions, such as the recruitment of new participant countries and links with relevant regional organizations and networks

*How agendas are set*

The agendas of regional nodes meetings are defined by the regional representatives in consultation with the GBIF Nodes Steering Group (NSG) and the GBIF Secretariat.

This ensures that each meeting reflects regional needs while remaining connected to network-wide priorities and initiatives.
