## Icebreaker virtual networking activity

Goal: To encourage informal conversation between nodes so that people feel connected to the community. A good opportunity for new nodes to meet other members of the network. Encouraging active participation in the events from the very start.

Format: A virtual gathering to create the opportunity for ‘mingling’. We will design a few questions to stimulate discussion, but keep it fairly open. The session will be open for nodes and Secretariat staff to ‘drop in’. 

Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond and Maheva Bagard Laursen

## Panel discussions based on pre-recorded presentations

Goal: To share updates from the Secretariat and invited speakers from nodes on topics that were requested in the consultation with nodes, and enable nodes to ask questions for further discussion. Exploring key themes with a panel of experts from the community.

Format: We will provide key updates in the form of short pre-recorded presentations that can be reused as training materials or outreach materials (max 7 minutes per video). These will be available from the website and can be viewed at any time ahead of the panel. They will be grouped into two themes, and accompanied by a forum thread for posting questions ahead of a panel session on Zoom that brings together the presenters for a live discussion with question time.

### Theme 1: The role of nodes in GBIF’s next strategic period

## Live Q&A session based on pre-recorded presentations

Goal: To share updates from the Secretariat and invited speakers from nodes on topics that were requested in the consultation with nodes, and enable nodes to ask questions for further discussion.

Format: We will provide key updates in the form of short pre-recorded presentations that can be reused as training materials or outreach materials (max 7 minutes per video). These will be available from the website and can be viewed at any time ahead of the panel. They will be grouped into two themes, and accompanied by a forum thread for posting questions ahead of a live Q&A session with the presenters.

### Theme 3: Product development and tools

Pre-recorded presentations to watch ahead of the live session

+ Living Atlases Community update (Marie Elise Lecoq/Dave Martin/ Brazil/ Sweden/ Spain)
+ Hosted portals updates - any that have gone live- the process so far (Tim Robertson/ Morten Hoefft/ examples to showcase)
+ Future of the IPT (Tim Robertson, Mikhail Podolskiy, Matthew Blissett, Sylvain GBIF France tbc)
+ GBIF exports available on the cloud (Tim Robertson)
+ Regional and national branding and identity - Intro to using GBIF branding, and considerations in developing national and regional brands and identity for GBIF nodes (Kyle Copas)

Live Q&A with all presenters
Facilitator: Maheva

### Theme 4: Content and use

Pre-recorded presentations

+ GrSciColl intro video  - explaining what it is and why we are working on it (Marie Grosjean)
+ GBIF Backbone taxonomy: Reminder on how it assembled now and future perspectives for the Catalogue of Life + (Markus Döring/ Olaf Banki tbc)
+ Working with issues and flags, including highlighting data blog (Andrea Hahn, John Waller, Marie Grosjean)
+ Sensitive species working group (Andrew Rodrigues)
+ Analyzing GBIF downloads from contributed datasets (Niels Raes tbc)

Live Q&A with all presenters
Facilitator: Laura

## Speed dating networking activity 

Goal: For nodes to share ideas for collaborative projects with other nodes in the network. For nodes to learn more about the work of other nodes in the network.

Format: We will try to recreate the speed-dating that we did in Leiden using breakout rooms in Zoom. We will need a facilitation team and some discussion questions, focusing on identifying potential areas for collaboration.

Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond, Maheva Bagaard Laursen

## Live demos

Goal: For Nodes and Secretariat to show practical demonstrations of how to use GBIF-related tools and materials.

Format: These should be more like ‘training’ than the pre-recorded presentations, i.e. guiding the participants through a demo of something practical. The sessions should be recorded and made available after the sessions. The demos will be grouped into themes.

### Group 1 - data mobilization training and guidance on sequence-derived data mobilization

Possible topics/presenters:

+ How to teach the GBIF Data Mobilization course on site and online (Laura Russell + trainers from the nodes community) (40 min)
+ Guide and training materials to support sequence-derived data in GBIF (Dmitry Schigel and BioDATA team) (40 min)
+ 1 node-led demo tbc from those who volunteered in the consultation

### Group 2 - Node level data quality workflows

Node presenters to be confirmed, but likely to include Colombia, VertNet, and others from this CESP project

### Group 3 - Tools to support nodes with data mobilization strategies

+ How to administer an IPT: New IPT Demo together with Regional IPTs (IPT admin features) (Laura Russell and Mikhail Podolskiy and Regional IPT admins tbc) (25 min)
+ GrSciColl: how nodes can make use of GrSciColl and contribute (Marie Grosjean) (20 min)
+ GBIF and Github; what is GitHub, how do we use it (product, content, development tracking), how to log an issue, orientation on the repositories, the portal-feedback “country” issue tag and how nodes could use that (Marie Grosjean/Morten Hoefft) (25 min)
+ 1 node-led demo tbc from those who volunteered in the consultation

### Group 4 - Marine data mobilization

OBIS marine data and GBIF nodes (Ward Appeltans, Abby Benson, Dag Endresen, Dairo Escobar) (1 hour)

## Regional nodes sessions

Goal: To continue node level discussions in regional groups led by the regional representatives. To discuss ideas for regional engagement sessions later in the year.

Format: 1.5 hour zoom meetings led by regional representatives and at appropriate time zones for the region.

Content: Agenda to be set by regional representatives.

## Drop-in help desk

Goal: To allow nodes to drop in to less formal sessions to ask any specific questions to Secretariat staff. 

Format: 1 hour zoom slots where Nodes can drop in.

Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond, Maheva Bagard Laursen, Marie Grosjean, Laura Russell

## GBIF.org functionality - NODES Vs. HELPDESK  

Goal: To demonstrate some of the lesser known functionalities of GBIF.org through a fun interactive session

Format: 1 hour session where nodes will ‘battle’ Marie to find answers to pre-prepared questions using filters and metrics on GBIF.org (Marie Grosjean live battle - Morten to help answer questions; Matt Blisset, Tim Robertson, John Waller, Andrea Hahn to prepare questions)

## Evaluation activities

Goal: to capture feedback from the nodes on the first virtual global nodes meeting

Format: Survey and short open floor discussion for closing remarks.

Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond, Maheva Bagard Laursen
