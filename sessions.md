## Icebreaker virtual networking activity

Goal: To encourage informal conversation between nodes to ensure that everyone feels connected to the community, new nodes can meet other members of the network, and that there is active participation in the events from the very start.

Format: A virtual gathering to create the opportunity for ‘mingling’. We will design a few questions to stimulate discussion, but keep it fairly open. The session will be open for nodes and Secretariat staff to ‘drop in’.

Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond and Maheva Bagard Laursen


## Panel discussions exploring key themes introduced in pre-recorded presentations

Goal: To explore key themes with panels of experts from the community, building on presentations from the nodes and Secretariat on topics that were requested in the consultation with nodes.

Format: Key updates will be available from this page in the form of short pre-recorded presentations that can be reused as training materials or outreach materials.

Please view the presentations ahead of the live panel discussions and use the GBIF community forum to ask any questions ahead of the live sessions. You can also ask questions during the panel discussions.

### Group 1 – data mobilization training and guidance on sequence-derived data mobilization

+ How to teach the GBIF Data Mobilization course on site and online 
+ Guide and training materials to support sequence-derived data in GBIF 


### Group 2 – tools to support nodes with data mobilization strategies

+ How to administer an IPT 
+ How nodes can make use of GrSciColl and contribute 
+ GBIF and Github: what is GitHub, how do we use it (product, content, development tracking), how to log an issue, orientation on the repositories, the portal-feedback “country” issue tag and how nodes could use that


### Group 3 – additional node updates and demos

Node presenters to be confirmed. If you still have a presentation or a demo you would like us to consider, please contact [nodes@gbif.org](mailto:nodes@gbif.org) before 16 June. 




## Regional nodes sessions

Goal: To continue node-level discussions in regional groups led by the regional representatives.

Format: 1.5 hour zoom meetings led by regional representatives and at appropriate time zones for the region.

Content: Agenda to be set by regional representatives.


## Marine data mobilization session

Goal: To update the community on the collaboration between GBIF and OBIS and discuss how we can work together on marine data mobilization

Format: A pre-recorded presentation will introduce the collaboration and examples of how GBIF nodes and OBIS are working together. A 1.5 hour live session will be an opportunity to discuss how we can strengthen collaboration and work towards common guidelines for marine data publishing that would go to both GBIF and OBIS in one step.

A pre-recorded presentation to watch ahead of the live session will be posted here from 23 June 2021.


## GBIF.org functionality – NODES Vs. HELPDESK

Goal: To demonstrate some of the lesser known functionalities of GBIF.org through a fun interactive session
