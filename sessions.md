## Icebreaker virtual networking activity

Goal: To encourage informal conversation between nodes to ensure that everyone feels connected to the community, new nodes can meet other members of the network, and that there is active participation in the events from the very start.

Format: A virtual gathering to create the opportunity for ‘mingling’. We will design a few questions to stimulate discussion, but keep it fairly open. The session will be open for nodes and Secretariat staff to ‘drop in’.

* *What is your link to the GBIF community?*

* *Why did you choose to attend the Global Nodes Meeting? 

* *Do you love working from home or would you rather be in the office? 

* *Where are you joining this meeting from? Your office? Your kitchen table? The backyard? A café? A museum?

* *How many cups of coffee, tea, or beverage-of-choice have you had before this meeting?

Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond and Maheva Bagard Laursen


## Panel discussions exploring key themes introduced in pre-recorded presentations

Goal: To explore key themes with panels of experts from the community, building on presentations from the nodes and Secretariat on topics that were requested in the consultation with nodes.

Format: Key updates will be available from this page in the form of short pre-recorded presentations that can be reused as training materials or outreach materials.

Please view the presentations ahead of the live panel discussions and use the GBIF community forum to ask any questions ahead of the live sessions. You can also ask questions during the panel discussions.

## Speed dating networking activity

Goal: For nodes to share ideas for collaborative projects with other nodes in the network.

Format: We will use breakout rooms in Zoom and engage conversation with each other around the questions below: 

* *What type of support do you receive for your node activities?

* *What are the main areas of success in resourcing your node’s activities / How did you successfully argue the case for GBIF participation?

* *What tips and recommendations on resourcing (funding sources, institutional support, support from the local/national/regional network, support from GBIF community, in kind support, etc.) and key areas of success can you share?

* *In your experience, what are the most efficient tools to demonstrate the importance of GBIF nodes and the importance of formal GBIF participation /What would be the tools you wish you had to  demonstrate the importance of GBIF nodes and the importance of formal GBIF participation?

## Live demos

Goal: For Nodes and Secretariat to show practical demonstrations of how to use GBIF-related tools and materials.

+ Guide and training materials to support sequence-derived data in GBIF 


### Group 2 – tools to support nodes with data mobilization strategies

+ How to administer an IPT 
+ How nodes can make use of GrSciColl and contribute 
+ GBIF and Github: what is GitHub, how do we use it (product, content, development tracking), how to log an issue, orientation on the repositories, the portal-feedback “country” issue tag and how nodes could use that


### Group 3 – additional node updates and demos

Node presenters to be confirmed. If you still have a presentation or a demo you would like us to consider, please contact [nodes@gbif.org](mailto:nodes@gbif.org) before 16 June. 



## Regional nodes sessions

Goal: To continue node-level discussions in regional groups led by the regional representatives.
