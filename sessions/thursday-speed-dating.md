# Speed dating networking activity
*Facilitators: Mélianie Raymond, Maheva Bagaard Laursen*

**Goal** For nodes to share ideas for collaborative projects with other nodes in the network.

**Format** We will use breakout rooms in Zoom and engage conversation with each other around the questions below: 

* *What type of support do you receive for your node activities?*

* *What are the main areas of success in resourcing your node’s activities / How did you successfully argue the case for GBIF participation?*

* *What tips and recommendations on resourcing (funding sources, institutional support, support from the local/national/regional network, support from GBIF community, in kind support, etc.) and key areas of success can you share?*

* *In your experience, what are the most efficient tools to demonstrate the importance of GBIF nodes and the importance of formal GBIF participation /What would be the tools you wish you had to  demonstrate the importance of GBIF nodes and the importance of formal GBIF participation?*
