# Live Q&A session based on pre-recorded presentations
*Live Q&A with all presenters Facilitator: Maheva Bagard Laursen*

**Goal** To share updates from nodes and the Secretariat on topics that were requested in the consultation with nodes, and enable nodes to ask questions for further discussion.

**Format** Key updates will be available from this page in the form of short pre-recorded presentations that can be reused as training materials or outreach materials (max 7 minutes per video).
